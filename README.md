# My Collision Algorithms

### Algorithms for different collision events are listed as follows:

1. Displace - between a moving body and a fixed body
   ```javascript
   displace(body1, body2)
   ```

2. Collide - between a moving body and a fixed body
   ```javascript
   collide(body1, body2)
   ```

3. Bounce Off - between a moving body and a fixed body
   ```javascript
   bounceOff(body1, body2)
   ```

4. Touch - between a moving body and a fixed body

    *Similar to isTouching()*
  
    ```javascript
    changeColor(body1, body2)
    ```
  
5. Bounce - between two moving bodies
   ```javascript
   bounce(body1, body2)
   ```
