# My Collision Algorithms

### Algorithms for different collision events in the following order:

1. Displace - between a moving & a fixed object
    ```javascript
    displace(body1, body2)
    ```
    
2. Collide - between a moving & a fixed object
    ```javascript
    collide(body1, body2)
    ```
    
3. Bounce Off -  between a moving & a fixed object
    ```javascript
    bounceOff(body1, body2)
    ```
    
 4. Touch -  between a moving & a fixed object
    * isTouching() or not checking *
    ```javascript
    changeColor(body1, body2)
    ```
    
 5. Bounce -  between two moving objects
    ```javascript
    bounce(body1, body2)
    ```
